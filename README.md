This is the repository for running the simulations from the paper by Louvrier et al. 2024 "How reliably can species co-occurrence be inferred from occupancy models?"

"SimulSevenLevelsPredation_FitUnmarkedPr0.6_08_bothPsiA_6LevelsSites.r": Function to simulate the data and fit them with the Rota et al. 2016 model.          
"RunSimulsPr0.6_0.8_bothPisA0.5_6LevelsSites.r": calls the function and fit it to different levels of occupancy of the dominant species A, repetitions, number of sites, and detection probabilities           
"Results_simuls_plot_SevenLevels.rmd": script to process the data           
"Plot_AllResults.rmd": script to plot the results
